# Heavenly Blue UE4 Test

Heavenly Blue is a long term project that I've been intrested in making for a while now. Since I was a young child, I've always been intrested in the Paper Mario game series. I was also a huge fan of anime, and was continously dissappointed with the representation of anime characters in video games. The core issue stems from the transition from a 2D drawing to a 3D model, and for the most part, up until very recently this problem was far from solved. Back when I realized this issue, I considered the possibility of just using a 2D sprite, but in a 3D enviroment. And so, Heavenly Blue was born!
