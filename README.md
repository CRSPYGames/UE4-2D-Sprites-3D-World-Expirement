# Heavenly Blue UE4 Test
Your favorite home invasion survivor horror detective slice-of-life waifu simulator. 

This will be a COMPLETELY open-source project. This is also my first solo-dev experience where I'm responsible for all asset creation.
This was made using Unreal Engine 4.24 and almost exclusively C++. The music was created using GarageBand. The art was created using Blender3D and Photoshop.
For the most part, although I technically made the assets, it was mostly mental gymnastics as opposed to "talent".

Here's a mockup of the type of aesthetic I'm going for:

Because this is just a mockup, none of the assets in the video was created by me.
